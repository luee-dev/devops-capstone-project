## **Feature Description:**

**Feature**: Dockerize Customer Accounts Microservice

**As a** developer  
**I need** to containerize the customer accounts microservice using Docker  
**So that** the service can be deployed consistently across different environments.

<br><br>

## **Details and Assumptions:**

- Docker should be used to create a container for the microservice.  
- The Docker image should be pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).  
- The service should run smoothly within the Docker container.

<br><br>

## **Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
Given that the microservice code is ready  
When I build the Docker container  
Then the container should be built successfully  
And the microservice should run inside the container without errors
```
